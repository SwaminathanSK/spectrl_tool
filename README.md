# SPECTRL
This repo contains code for the paper "A Composable Specification Language for Reinforcement Learning Tasks" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09293). SPECTRL (SPECifying Tasks for Reinforcment Learning) is a tool that allows users to write RL specifications in a logical language and uses the specfication to automatically learn a policy. 

## Dependencies

* Python 3.5 or a later version
* Numpy
* Pytorch
* Gym

## Examples

To run examples in the paper, see ```spectrl/examples/car2d.py``` and ```spectrl/examples/cartpole```. To run 2d
navigation examples, run:
```
mkdir data
python3 -m spectrl.examples.car2d -n 0 -d data
```
The option ```-d``` is used to specify the directory to store files (eg. policy_file) generated by the
tool. ```-n``` is used to label the output files differently for different runs.
